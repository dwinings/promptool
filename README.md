# Promptool

A basic gui to make constructing a custom terminal prompt a little less soul-crushing.

# Directions

Run main.py with your python 2 interpreter. If you want to you can make main.py executable, if your python interpreter is at /usr/bin/python2. The first line can be changed for your convenience. The finished prompt can be tested by running it in the terminal, or saved by putting it in the ~/.shellrc, where shell is whatever shell you're using. (Only bash right now!).

# Bugs!.

If the program crashes or throws exceptions or gives off a malformed prompt (unless you fed it a weird string through copy/paste [I filter normal input]) please, let me know and file an issue

# Unimplemented Features!

Later on I'll be adding more features, like changing the prompt entry to a TextView, which will allow me to color and bold the text as appropriate while typing. I will also make the generated prompt show up in the gui somewhere, and possibly add other options. This is still a prototype of sorts, so I'm learning gtk and adding features as they occur to me, and I have time to implement them. 

# In Conclusion...

I hope this can be of some use to people out there! Feedback, feature ideas and anything else are appreciated.
